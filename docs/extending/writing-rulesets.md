# Writing Game Mode Rulesets

A ruleset tells Game Mode how a tabletop system works: which dice a check rolls, what is on the character sheet, which resources get spent, and what a rest gives back. This guide is for people who want to write their own and share it. To play on a ruleset somebody else made, start with [Choosing rules](../game/getting-started.md#choosing-rules).

A ruleset is one JSON file. It is data, not code. Nothing in it runs, so importing one cannot do anything to your computer. The one part that deserves a careful read before you import somebody else's file is the Game Master text, because that text is sent to the model in every game that uses the ruleset.

## Read this first: what a ruleset can and cannot do

A ruleset can only fill in the blanks of a mechanic the Engine already knows. Today the Engine knows one way to resolve a check, called `dice-sum`: roll some dice, add numbers from the sheet, and meet or beat a difficulty. You choose the dice, how a score becomes a modifier, what training is worth, whether advantage exists, and what natural results do. That covers d20 systems, 2d6 plus stat systems, and many others.

A mechanic that does not fit that shape cannot be written in a ruleset file. Dice pools that count successes, exploding dice, roll-under percentile checks, and degrees of success are examples. Each of those needs a new resolution kind inside the Engine, which is a code contribution with tests, not a JSON file. If your system needs one, open a feature request on the Engine repository and describe the mechanic with a few worked rolls. Those worked rolls become the tests.

Combat is separate too. Battles run on Marinara's own combat, in whichever Combat Preference the game was created with. A ruleset cannot change how a battle is resolved. What it can do is lend the battle the numbers on its character sheets, with an optional `battle` block: see [Battles](#battles-lending-the-sheet-to-marinaras-combat).

## Quickstart

1. Copy the example file [`ember-roads.json`](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/blob/staging/docs/examples/rulesets/ember-roads.json). It is a small 2d6 system with three stats, written to show that nothing in the format assumes a d20 or six abilities. For a full-size example, see the 5e (SRD 5.1) file in [`ruleset-5e-2014.example.json`](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/blob/staging/docs/development/ruleset-5e-2014.example.json).
2. Change `id` to your own. An id is lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphens, such as `ember-roads`.
3. Edit the sheet, the rests, and the Game Master text.
4. Import it (see [Trying your ruleset](#trying-your-ruleset)). The import checks the whole file and tells you what is wrong, line by line, before anything is saved.
5. Create a new game, pick your ruleset under **Rules**, and play a few checks.

For help while you type, point your editor at the JSON Schema by adding this as the first line inside the file's outer braces:

```json
"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/staging/docs/extending/ruleset.schema.json",
```

The schema catches misspelled keys and wrong types as you type. It cannot check that the names in your file point at things that exist, such as a skill naming an ability. The import does that.

You may add a `"$comment": "..."` line to any object in the file to leave yourself a note. The Engine ignores it.

## The parts of the file

| Key             | What it holds                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schemaVersion` | Always `1`.                                                                                       |
| `id`, `version` | Your ruleset's name for the Engine, and a whole number you raise every time you publish a change. |
| `name`          | What players see in the setup wizard.                                                             |
| `edition`       | Optional. One line about which edition or draft this is.                                          |
| `license`       | Optional. An SPDX id and the attribution text your source requires.                               |
| `coverage`      | What the ruleset handles, plus the one-line summary shown in the setup wizard.                    |
| `resolution`    | How a check or a save is rolled.                                                                  |
| `sheet`         | Everything on the character sheet.                                                                |
| `rests`         | What each kind of rest restores and clears.                                                       |
| `gm`            | The text the Game Master model is given, and which sheet values it sees for each character.       |
| `catalogs`      | Optional. Ready-made entries the sheet editor offers, so players do not type long lists by hand.  |
| `battle`        | Optional. What a battle may read from the sheet, and what it writes back afterwards.              |

The file may be up to 256 KB. Text that ends up in a prompt (names, labels, Game Master text) cannot contain line breaks, square brackets, or double curly braces.

Ids inside the sheet (abilities, skills, fields, pools, and so on) are lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, starting with a letter, such as `grit_max`.

### Resolution

```json
"resolution": {
  "kind": "dice-sum",
  "dice": { "count": 2, "sides": 6 },
  "abilityModifier": { "op": "identity" },
  "proficiencyTiers": [
    { "id": "untrained", "label": "Untrained" },
    { "id": "trained", "label": "Trained", "flat": 1 }
  ],
  "advantage": false,
  "difficultyLadder": [
    { "label": "Easy", "dc": 6 },
    { "label": "Hard", "dc": 10 }
  ]
}
```

- `dice`: how many dice and how many sides. The total is what gets compared to the difficulty.
- `abilityModifier`: how a score on the sheet becomes the number added to a roll. `identity` means the score is the modifier. `floorHalfMinusTen` is the 5e rule. `stepTable` lets you list your own thresholds as `[[score, modifier], ...]`.
- `proficiencyTiers`: the training levels a skill or save can have. The first one is what an unlisted skill gets. A tier adds `flat`, or `multiplier` times a proficiency bonus, or both. If your system has a proficiency bonus, name where it comes from with `"proficiency": { "bonus": { "derived": "proficiency_bonus" } }`.
- `advantage`: whether the Game Master may ask for the dice to be rolled twice and one roll kept.
- `naturals`: what the highest and lowest face of a single die do for checks and for saves: `none`, `both`, `max-only`, or `min-only`. Leave it out for pure arithmetic.
- `difficultyLadder`: the difficulties the Game Master is told to pick from.

### The sheet

- `sections` group things in the editor.
- `abilities` are the core scores. `skills` and `saves` each may name the ability they roll with.
- `fields` are single values. Types: `number`, `text`, `longtext`, `boolean`, `enum` (a fixed list of choices), and `dice` (text such as `1d8`).
- `derived` values are worked out from other values and cannot be typed over. The operations are `sum`, `min`, `max`, `scale` (multiply and round), and `stepTable` (look a value up in thresholds, the way a level gives a proficiency bonus).
- `lists` are tables with your own columns, such as gear, spells, or features. A list with `pools` turns every row into a resource with its own maximum, for class features with limited uses.
- `live` is what changes during play: `pools` (hit points, spell slots, Grit), `tracks` (a number on a scale, such as exhaustion), `text` (short notes such as what a character is concentrating on), and `conditions`.

Anything that reads a number names it with a value reference, which is an object with exactly one key: `const`, `field`, `derived`, `abilityScore`, `abilityMod`, `abilityModFromField`, `skillMod`, or `saveMod`. For example, a pool whose maximum is a derived value: `"max": { "derived": "grit_max" }`.

`hideWhen` hides a field, a list, or a pool when another field has a given value. The 5e file uses it to hide spell slots from a character who does not cast spells.

### Rests

A rest is a list of restore steps and things to clear. Each step names one target (`pool`, `poolGroup`, `listPools`, or `track`) and either sets it (`"to": "max"`, `"to": "min"`, or a number) or changes it (`"by": { "const": 1 }`, or `"by": { "fractionOfMax": 0.5 }`).

### Game Master text

- `checkGuidance` replaces the built-in paragraph that tells the Game Master how to ask for a check. Say which system this is and when to call for a roll. The Game Master only names the skill and the difficulty. The Engine rolls the dice and does the arithmetic from the sheet, so do not ask the model to do math.
- `sheetGuidance` introduces the character sheets in the prompt. Use it to say which resources matter and when to spend them.
- `sheetSummary` chooses which fields, derived values, and list rows the Game Master sees for each character. The Engine always shows ability modifiers, trained skills and saves, and live values. Keep the rest short, because it is sent on every turn.

## Catalogs: ready-made entries for the sheet's lists

Typing a spell list, a gear table, or a page of class features row by row is miserable. A catalog is a named collection of ready-made entries that you ship with the ruleset. The sheet editor offers them in a picker on every list the catalog feeds, and picking one fills the row in.

A catalog is optional. A ruleset may have up to twelve of them, and nothing in the Engine knows what any of them are about: every id, column, filter, and word comes from your file.

### The header

The header goes in `catalogs` at the top level of the file, beside `gm`.

```json
"catalogs": [
  {
    "id": "knacks",
    "label": "Knacks",
    "feeds": ["knacks", "tricks"],
    "filters": [
      { "id": "grit", "label": "Grit cost", "type": "number" },
      { "id": "road", "label": "Road", "type": "text" },
      { "id": "callings", "label": "Calling", "type": "tags", "startFrom": { "field": "calling" } }
    ],
    "units": { "distance": { "label": "paces", "perCell": 2 } },
    "entries": []
  }
]
```

- `id` and `label`: the id follows the sheet id rules, and the label is what the picker is called.
- `feeds`: the lists on your sheet that this catalog's entries may write into, one to eight of them. An entry can never write into a list that is not here, and it can never write a value the list's columns could not hold.
- `filters`: optional, up to eight. What the picker can narrow the list by. A filter is a `number`, a `text` value, or `tags` (several words). `startFrom` names a sheet field the picker opens on, so a character whose Calling is Tinker sees Tinker entries first.
- `units`: optional. What a range or an area size in an entry's `mechanics` block means in your system.

### An entry

```json
{
  "id": "road-sense",
  "label": "Road Sense",
  "summary": "You read a road the way other people read a face.",
  "filters": { "grit": 0, "road": "Ash Flats", "callings": ["Scout", "Courier"] },
  "rows": [
    {
      "list": "knacks",
      "values": { "name": "Road Sense", "notes": "Sneak to notice where a road turns bad." }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `id`: lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphens, unique inside the catalog.
- `label` and `summary`: what the picker shows. The summary is optional, one line, and up to 300 characters.
- `filters`: the values for the filters the header declared. A `number` filter takes a number, a `text` filter takes one string, and a `tags` filter takes a list of strings.
- `rows`: what picking the entry writes, one to six rows. `list` is one of the catalog's `feeds`, and `values` are keyed by that list's column ids.

Every value is checked against the target list's columns, so a mistyped column name or a number outside a column's range is reported with the entry it came from. Entries written inside the ruleset file are checked when the ruleset is loaded, which for an imported file means at import. A package's separate catalog file is checked when the picker first asks for it, and a file with a mistake shows its reasons there instead of any entries.

### One entry, several lists

A feature with limited uses is two rows on a sheet: the feature itself, and the counter that tracks it. That is still one pick.

```json
{
  "id": "last-ember",
  "label": "Last Ember",
  "rows": [
    {
      "list": "knacks",
      "values": { "name": "Last Ember", "notes": "Spend 1 Grit to give a downed friend 3 Grit back." }
    },
    { "list": "tricks", "values": { "name": "Last Ember", "uses": 1, "recharge": "camp" } }
  ]
}
```

### Picked rows are copies

Each picked row is copied onto the sheet with one extra key, `_catalog`, holding `<catalog id>/<entry id>`. Column ids always start with a letter, so this key can never be one of yours.

The copy is the character's. The player can edit any of it afterwards, the sheet keeps working while your ruleset is not installed, and publishing a new version of the ruleset never rewrites anyone's character. The mark is only there so the picker can show what a sheet already has.

### `mechanics`, for later

An entry may carry an optional `mechanics` block that says what it does in numbers: `kind` (`attack`, `heal`, `buff`, `debuff`, `utility`), `range`, `area`, `targets`, `friendlyFire`, `amount` (dice such as `2d6`, or a flat number), `damageType`, `attackRoll`, `save` (one of your sheet's saves, and what a success does), `cost` (which pool using it spends), `perCostStep`, `concentration`, and `reaction`.

The picker shows this block as one line. A battle reads part of it, but only when your ruleset opts in with a [`battle` block](#battles-lending-the-sheet-to-marinaras-combat), and only the parts Marinara's own combat has somewhere to put. It reads `kind`, `range`, `area`, `friendlyFire`, `amount`, `damageType` and `cost`. Four fields stay in the file and are never read or applied by a battle: `attackRoll`, `save`, `concentration` and `perCostStep`. The vocabulary is closed, so a key or a value that is not in the list above is refused instead of being quietly ignored.

### Inline, or a file of its own

A small catalog sits inline in `ruleset.json`, in the header's `entries`. A long one lives in its own file and the header names it with `asset` instead. A catalog has exactly one of the two.

```json
{ "id": "knacks", "label": "Knacks", "feeds": ["knacks"], "asset": "catalogs/knacks.json" }
```

The path is always `catalogs/<the catalog's id>.json`. The file itself looks like this:

```json
{ "schemaVersion": 1, "catalog": "knacks", "entries": [] }
```

Separate catalog files are for packages published through the official catalog: the package lists the file in `contributions.assets.paths` beside `ruleset.json`, and it needs Capability API 1.21. **A ruleset you import as a single file, or share through a GitHub repository, carries its catalogs inline**, which means they have to fit inside the 256 KB limit on the whole ruleset file. That is room for a few hundred short entries.

The limits are 12 catalogs per ruleset, 2000 entries per catalog either way, and 1 MB for one catalog file.

## Battles: lending the sheet to Marinara's combat

By default a battle knows nothing about the sheet. It builds its fighters the way it always has, and
a character can walk out of a fight with their hit points on the sheet untouched.

An optional `battle` block changes that, in one direction only: it lends the fight the sheet's
numbers, and writes the fight's outcome back. **It does not make combat follow your rules.** The
dice math is still Marinara's, and so is who hits whom and for how much. Because of that, health is
carried as a share of the maximum rather than as your own number: a character at half health on the
sheet starts the fight at half of the health bar Marinara built for them. Your 9-point health pool
is never dropped into a fight where one blow does 12.

```json
"battle": {
  "health": { "pool": "grit" },
  "energy": { "pool": "luck" },
  "skills": [{ "list": "knacks" }]
}
```

- `health`: required. The live pool that is the character's hit points in a fight. It must be one of
  the pools in `sheet.live.pools`, not a list whose rows are pools.
- `energy`: optional. A live pool the fight may spend, which becomes the MP bar. It has to be a
  different pool from `health`, because a fight cannot spend hit points as fuel.
- `slots`: optional. Live pools that a fight spends one at a time, each with a `level` from 1 to 9:
  `[{ "pool": "slots_1", "level": 1 }]`. Levels and pools are each used once.
- `skills`: optional, up to eight. The sheet lists whose rows become the character's combat skills.
  Only rows that came from one of your catalogs count, and only when the entry behind the row has a
  `mechanics` block: a row somebody typed by hand says nothing in numbers. `onlyWhen` names a boolean
  column the row must have set, such as a prepared spell. `alwaysWhen` names a column and a value
  that lets a row through anyway, such as the spells that are cast without being prepared. It is
  the exception to `onlyWhen`, so it is refused without one beside it.

### What is carried in, and what is carried out

**In**, for each party member whose sheet the game has: the health pool's share of its maximum sets
where the fighter starts on Marinara's own health bar, the energy pool becomes MP, each slot pool
becomes that level's slots, and the marked rows become skills. Maximum hit points, attack, defense,
speed and level stay Marinara's own numbers. A character at zero in the health pool starts the fight
down, because that is what the sheet says, and a character above zero never starts below one hit
point, so a small share cannot knock somebody out by rounding.

**Out**, once the fight is over: the share of the health bar the fighter ended on is read back onto
the health pool's own scale, and the difference from where the fight began is applied as damage or
healing. Energy and slots are counts, not shares, so they are written back as they are. Everything
goes through the same rules the sheet's own buttons follow, and a change the sheet refuses is
skipped and reported rather than forced. A fight that did not move a fighter's hit points writes no
health change at all, so the two conversions can never move a sheet by themselves.

**Neither**: attack rolls, saving throws, concentration, and what a higher cost would add. Those are
in the `mechanics` block for a real combat system to read one day; this bridge does not apply them,
and a ruleset should not claim it does.

An abandoned battle writes nothing back. If you delete the message the fight started in, or the
fight never reaches its end, the sheet is exactly as it was: the fight did not happen.

### How an entry becomes a skill

A catalog entry's `mechanics` block is read like this:

- `kind` becomes the skill's type. `utility` entries and anything marked `reaction` are left out,
  because Marinara's combat has nowhere to put them.
- `amount` sets how hard it lands, as a multiplier against the fighter's own attack rather than as a
  damage number. Bigger dice never land softer, and the multiplier stays inside the range a
  generated skill already uses.
- `range` and `area.size` are divided by the catalog's `units.distance.perCell` to get grid cells,
  and never round down to nothing. A burst becomes its radius, a cone half of it, and a line one
  cell. Anything with an area targets every enemy it covers, and `friendlyFire` is honoured.
- `damageType` becomes the skill's element. `targets` is not carried: Marinara's combat decides who
  a heal, a buff or an attack can be pointed at from the skill's type.
- `cost` on the energy pool becomes the MP cost, and several energy costs are added up. A `cost` of
  exactly one slot spends one slot of that level. Marinara's combat charges one number of energy
  or one slot, never both, so an entry that costs two slots, slots of two levels, or a slot plus
  energy is left out of the fight. So is a cost on any other pool, such as hit points or a class
  resource, because the Engine would otherwise hand it out for free.
- A `buff` or a `debuff` becomes Marinara's own buff or debuff. Whatever else the entry's text
  promises, such as clearing a condition on the sheet, is not applied in the fight. Leave
  `mechanics` off an entry whose effect only makes sense outside a battle.

`coverage.combat` is separate and still means what it meant: set it only when battles really do
follow your system's rules, which no ruleset can do from a file today.

## Trying your ruleset

Community rulesets use the same switch as imported agents. Open **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Danger Zone** and make sure **Allow custom Agent imports** is on. Importing also needs localhost access or configured **Admin Access**.

1. Open the **Agents** panel and choose the **Import agents** button (the download icon in the row of buttons at the top of the panel).
2. Pick **Game Mode ruleset** and choose your JSON file.
3. Read the review. It shows the name, version, license, what the ruleset covers, and the Game Master text. Choose **Import**.

Your ruleset appears in the panel's **Rules** section and in the setup wizard's **Rules** choice for new games. A ruleset imported from a file is filed as `local/<your id>`, so it can never be confused with an official ruleset or with somebody else's.

### Changing a ruleset you already imported

A version that has been imported is never rewritten. If you change the file and import it again with the same `version`, the import is refused and asks you to raise the number. This is on purpose: a game is tied to the exact version it was created on, so a running campaign never wakes up on different math.

So the loop while you are drafting is: edit, raise `version`, import, start a new game. Old versions stay installed beside the new one until you remove the ruleset from the **Rules** section. Removing a ruleset that a game still uses makes that game say its ruleset is missing until you import it again.

If you change the shape of the sheet (add, remove, or rename things), raise `sheet.version` too. Existing sheets are read tolerantly: values the new sheet does not know are kept, and missing ones take their defaults.

## Sharing your ruleset

**As a file.** Send the JSON file to a friend. They import it the same way you did.

**From a GitHub repository.** If you keep your work in a public GitHub repository, put each ruleset in a `rulesets` folder at the top of the repository, one file per ruleset:

```text
your-repository/
  agents.json        (optional, only if you also share agents)
  rulesets/
    ember-roads.json
    another-system.json
```

A user adds your repository once through the custom agent repository list, reviews what it holds, and can sync later to receive new versions. The custom repository list is an advanced feature that the person running the server has to turn on with `ENABLE_CUSTOM_AGENT_REPOS=true`. Rulesets from a repository are filed under the repository owner's name, such as `alice/ember-roads`, so two authors can both publish a ruleset called `v20` without clashing.

Two limits apply. A repository can hold at most 32 JSON files directly inside `rulesets`, and one with more is refused. An account named `local` cannot publish rulesets, because `local/` is kept for rulesets imported from a file.

**In the official catalog.** A widely played system with clean licensing can be offered to everyone through **Download Agents**. That is a pull request to the [Marinara-Agents](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Agents) repository. Look at the `ruleset-5e-2014` package there for the layout.

## Licensing

Only publish rules text you have the right to share. Many systems publish a reference document under an open license, and that document is what you may copy from. Put the license id and the attribution text the license asks for under `license`. Do not copy text from rulebooks that are not openly licensed. A ruleset mostly needs names and numbers, and the Game Master text should be your own words.

## Troubleshooting

- **The import says a name does not exist.** Something in the file points at an id that is not declared, such as a skill naming an ability you removed. The message gives the path to the line.
- **The import says a version is already installed with different contents.** Raise `version` and import again.
- **My ruleset is missing from the setup wizard.** Check that **Allow custom Agent imports** is on. While it is off, imported rulesets are left out of new games. Games that already use one keep working.
- **A game says its ruleset is missing.** The exact version the game was created on is not installed. Import that version of the file again.
