// ── Per-chat write ordering (#5406) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// A game-surface Experience keeps its save in two stores: the per-anchor
// game_engine_state row (the authority, rewinds with the story) and a top-level chat-metadata
// key it maintains as a boot cache (chat-global, never rewinds). Nothing let a client tell
// "metadata is ahead because the last session degraded to metadata-only writes" from "the row
// is behind because the player swiped back", so a degraded session's play was simply lost.
//
// The fix is one counter both paths draw from: `chats.writeOrdinalCounter`. Every allocation
// is a read-and-bump of that column performed INSIDE the per-chat metadata patch queue
// (`withChatMetadataPatchQueue`), which is what makes the sequence monotonic even though the
// two writers hold different locks — the experience-state route holds its own per-chat write
// lock and then calls `allocateWriteOrdinal`, which takes the metadata queue on top. The lock
// order is always experience-lock -> metadata-queue and never the reverse, so there is no
// deadlock, and because every allocation funnels through the one queue no two writes can read
// the same counter value. Crashing between an allocation and the write it stamps burns an
// ordinal; the contract is strict ordering, not density, so gaps are fine.
//
// The counter is not trusted on its own, because a metadata blob (mirror included) can be MOVED
// into a chat that never allocated those ordinals — branching, a game "Next Session" carry, a
// restored backup. Every allocation therefore floors the counter by the ordinals the chat's own
// mirror already carries (`writeOrdinalFloor`), and the branch seam additionally raises the
// counter above every engine-row ordinal it copied.
