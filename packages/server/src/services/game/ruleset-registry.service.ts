// Game: ruleset registry
//
// Reads every installed package's `ruleset.json` plus every community ruleset the user imported,
// validates them as data, and resolves the ruleset a game pinned at creation
// (`chat.metadata.gameRuleset`). No pin means `engine-legacy`: today's behaviour, untouched. A pin
// this install cannot honour is reported, never reinterpreted — the game's arithmetic must not
// change silently because a package went away or is older than the pin.
//
// Official rulesets are keyed by their bare id and community ones by their NAMESPACED id, so an
// import can never shadow a package's ruleset and two authors' `v20` are two entries. The import
// policy is not consulted here: turning imports off hides community rulesets from NEW games (see
// the `/create` handler), and must never break a game that already pinned one.
