// Game: one-request dice — the chance pass and its wrapper
//
// A Game turn that rolls dice costs two provider requests today: the GM writes a
// draft with roll requests in it, the engine rolls, and the whole prompt goes back
// so the GM can rewrite the narration with the real numbers. With
// `gameOneRequestDice` on, the GM commits its prose first — both halves of a binary
// outcome, or a placeholder where a number goes — the engine rolls after the
// writing is done, and the rewrite request never fires. The model never sees a
// number before it decides what happens, so it cannot steer the outcome.
//
// ONE session per turn, TWO insertion points, for reasons that are load-bearing:
//
//   1. The branch arm runs before spatial extraction and before the package-verb
//      strip, so a discarded half's commands are gone before anything collects them.
//   2. The placeholder arm runs immediately AFTER the verb strip, so a placeholder
//      inside a verb's argument is already gone with the verb and is never rolled.
//      It cannot run at point 1: the verb table is not fetched until after spatial
//      extraction, so a pass placed there has nothing to compare a `[verb:` head
//      against.
//
// The failure contract is absolute and is the point of the wrapper: the pass never
// throws out of this module. On an internal failure the turn is saved with a notice
// and the affected tags are left sparse, no `[[roll:` span survives into saved
// content for a downstream stripper to half-eat, no branch delimiter survives
// either, and no second provider request is ever made. Nothing here invents a die
// result, a modifier, a total or an outcome.
//
// Both arms are real. Arm 1 keeps the half a live roll selects and deletes the other one
// before anything collects a command out of it; arm 2 rolls `[[roll: 2d6+3]]` with the
// session's crypto roller and substitutes the total, adding sheet modifiers by name
// through the same arithmetic a skill check uses. Each arm's grammar and bounded-span
// walk live in a shared module beside the tag it reads; what lives here is the
// chat-shaped half — the sheet, the roll, the ledger, the dice history and the log.

 * record wholesale: the first segment's `placeholders[]` disappear, and with them the
 * inline breakdown on numbers the player already read, along with every log line saying
 * what the engine could not roll. The sibling `diceRollResults` retains the earlier
 * segment explicitly for exactly this reason, and this is the same retention.
 *
 * Counts sum, lists concatenate in segment order, `forms` keeps first-seen order, and a
 * fold that has nothing in it is `null` rather than an empty object, so a chat that never
 * rolled anything stores exactly what it stored before.
 *
 * `previous` is typed `unknown` because it comes back off a stored message extra, which is
 * parsed JSON and not a validated shape. Every field is read through a guard, so a
 * transcript carrying something else in that key degrades to "no earlier segment" rather
 * than writing a malformed record back over a good one.
