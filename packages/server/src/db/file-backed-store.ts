/**
 * Anchor prefix an experience-state import stamps on a row whose exported anchor is not a
 * message of the DESTINATION chat (#5405) — a campaign replayed into a different chat, or one
 * whose anchor message was deleted before the re-import.
 *
 * Two properties make it load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
 *   - The `messages -> game_engine_state` cascade below matches on `messageId` ALONE, never
 *     scoped by chatId. Storing the caller-supplied id verbatim would let the SOURCE chat's
 *     message deletions silently destroy the imported campaign in the destination chat.
 *     A prefixed id can never equal a real `messages.id`, so no cascade can ever match it.
 *   - The row is still perfectly usable: the experience-state GET falls back to the latest
 *     committed/latest row when the visible anchor has no save of its own, which is exactly
 *     how an imported campaign becomes playable.
 * These anchors are therefore DANGLING BY DESIGN, which is why the
 * `game_engine_state.messageId` cascade is listed in CASCADE_DANGLING_EXEMPT_PREFIXES below —
 * otherwise `mari db validate` would report every imported row as an integrity error.

  /**
   * Registers capability-package tables against the running store. Everything a

   * container, its rows read off disk, membership in the flush loop and in the
   * manifest — because the alternative is a table that accepts writes and
   * silently loses them.
   *
   * Registered tables are SHARDED, like every Engine table (SHARDED_TABLES
   * aliases FILE_BACKED_TABLES, so pushing a name makes it sharded whether we
   * want it or not). Making them flat would mean opting a new table into the
   * store's least-exercised path and would still leave the alias lying about
   * them. One file per primary key, the default strategy for a table with no
   * SHARD_KEY_COLUMNS entry.
   *
   * Failures are per-table and non-fatal: a package with one malformed table
   * definition must not take the host down with it.
   *
   * Known constraint: the registries this writes (tableMetasByName,
   * FILE_BACKED_TABLE_SET, SHARDED_TABLE_SET) are process-global, as the
   * Engine's own table metadata already is. A registered name therefore
   * outlives the store that registered it, so a later store built in the same
   * process — a different storage directory, say — sees the name at boot and
   * loads it from its own directory, finding nothing. That degrades to an
   * empty table rather than to corruption or a cross-directory read, and
   * production runs one store per process, so it is accepted here rather than
   * threading instance-scoped registries through getMeta and every lookup that
   * calls it. Tests that construct more than one store must use distinct table
   * names, or a name registered by an earlier case makes a later one pass
   * without exercising this method at all. Per-instance registries are the
   * correct fix if the Engine ever runs several stores at once.
