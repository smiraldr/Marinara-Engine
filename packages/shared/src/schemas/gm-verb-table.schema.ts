// prompt render and the executor land with the runtime.

 *  silent in both directions. */

/** Bracket-tag names the Engine already owns, case-folded, so a package verb can never shadow a

 *  whichever path matched first. `whisper` is the sharpest of them: a package verb by that name
 *  would have `[whisper:Tam]` cut out of a dialogue line before save, and the line stops matching
 *  the dialogue grammar for good.
 *
 *  Derived from two kinds of source, all of them swept by `capability-gm-verbs.regression.ts` so
 *  the pin cannot rot silently:
 *    1. The prompt renders — every `[name:` the GM format reminder
 *       (`packages/server/src/services/game/gm-prompts.ts`) and the party/VN reminder
 *       (`party-prompts.ts`) can emit across all of their branches (`reputation`, `skill_check`,
 *       `state`, `whisper`, `[Note:`/`[Book:` and the rest).
 *    2. The narration parsers — every bracket name the Engine matches back out of a finished turn.
 *       There are five. Two of them carry names nothing else does: the client tag parser
 *       (`packages/client/src/lib/game-tag-parser.ts`), whose set is wider than any reminder
 *       renders (`ambient`, `direction`, `music`, `element_attack`, …) and the only source of
 *       `party-chat`/`party-turn`, and the client narration formatter
 *       (`packages/client/src/components/game/game-narration-format.ts`), the only source of
 *       `qte_bonus`/`qte_result`, which it renders as command badges mid-stream. Which name is
 *       unique to which source shifts as the list grows: `element_attack` held the tag parser's
 *       half of that pin until the narration formatter — which matches it too — joined, so
 *       uniqueness is re-audited whenever a source is added rather than assumed to survive.
 *       The other three — the server's segment editor
 *       (`packages/server/src/services/game/segment-edits.ts`), the sidecar scene analyzer
 *       (`packages/server/src/services/sidecar/scene-analyzer.ts`) and the generate route's
 *       dialogue rewriter (`packages/server/src/routes/generate/generate-route-utils.ts`) — add no
 *       name the first two do not already yield today, and are swept so that a token arriving in
 *       one of them first cannot become shadowable unnoticed.
 *  The four that carry the dialogue tokens spell them as a regex alternation
 *  (`\[(main|side|extra|action|thought|whisper…)\]`), so the sweep walks alternation groups instead
 *  of reading one name per bracket. Those tokens are pinned from the parsers on purpose: the
 *  reminder renders them inside an alternation (`[main|side|whisper:Target|thought]`) that a
 *  `[name:` scan cannot see, and a bare-bracket scan of a prompt file would collect the example
 *  speaker names and expressions standing next to them. A shadowed name does its damage where the
 *  Engine parses it, so that is where the pin is derived.
 *  Case-folding is load-bearing: the reminder renders `[Note:`/`[Book:` capitalized and the shipped
 *  parse regex is case-insensitive, so a lowercase `note` verb would shadow the journal tag.
 *  `party-chat`/`party-turn` cannot collide anyway — a verb name may not contain a hyphen — and are
 *  kept so the pin matches its sources exactly, which is also what leaves them free to serve as the
 *  tag parser's canary.
 *  `roll` is the one name here that no sweep above yields, and it is reserved by hand for two
 *  colliding readers a package verb would shadow: Roleplay mode's own `[roll: character="…"]`
 *  command (`packages/server/src/services/generation/roleplay-commands.ts`), and the inner
 *  `[roll: 2d6+3]` of a Game placeholder, both of which match `CAPABILITY_COMMAND_TAG_PATTERN`
 *  exactly. `capability-gm-verbs.regression.ts` pins the reservation rather than derives it.
 *  `branch` and `on` are reserved by hand for the same reason and are NOT the same case as each
 *  other, so the difference is written down rather than implied. `[branch: crates]` matches
 *  `CAPABILITY_COMMAND_TAG_PATTERN` exactly, so a package verb named `branch` would intercept
 *  every one-request dice branch block before the engine's own arm ever saw it: that one is a
 *  real shadow. `on` is DEFENSIVE ONLY and cannot fire — `[on success]` puts a space between the
 *  name and the `]`, which that pattern does not accept — so it closes the name space without
 *  buying a fix, and it must never be cited as the reason the delimiters get stripped. What
 *  strips them is a literal pattern in `utils/dice-branch.ts`; no name set on either side
 *  reaches `[on success]` or `[/branch]` at all. */

/** Chat-metadata namespaces the Engine reads and writes itself. A package whose normalized id is
 *  one of these — or extends one at an uppercase boundary, which is exactly where a colliding key
 *  is minted — may not own metadata keys at all.
 *
 *  Derived, and pinned by `capability-gm-verbs.regression.ts`, from:
 *    1. every top-level key of `ChatMetadata` (`packages/shared/src/types/chat.ts`), reduced to its
 *       leading lowercase run: `gameSetupConfig` → `game`, `lorebookTokenBudget` → `lorebook`,
 *       unless an explicitly narrower compound namespace such as `advancedMemory` already covers it;
 *    2. every engine-owned `*_METADATA_KEY` constant in the server, reduced the same way — these
 *       are keys no interface declares (`metadataWriteOrdinals`, the write-ordinal mirror);
 *    3. the keys that live in the interface's `[key: string]: unknown` index signature instead of
 *       in its declaration. A large share of the Engine's real chat metadata is undeclared this way
 *       (`encounterActive`, `internalAssistant`, `professorMariActive`, `imageGenConnectionId`,
 *       `authorNotes`), and sources 1 and 2 are structurally blind to all of it — a package
 *       squatting one of those namespaces could overwrite an Engine key from model output. It takes
 *       seven sub-sources, because no single one covers the vocabulary: the object literal a
 *       `patchMetadata`/`updateMetadata` call passes; the object literal an updater callback
 *       RETURNS, a shape the Engine reaches for about as often as the first; the client's own
 *       `useUpdateChatMetadata()` mutation and its `onMetadataChange` prop, which PATCH chat
 *       metadata without going near `patchMetadata`; the client's DIRECT `PATCH
 *       /chats/:id/metadata` calls, which skip that hook as well (`GameSurface.tsx` writes combat,
 *       scene and narration keys this way); the `chatMetadata.key` / `chat.metadata.key` property
 *       reads; property reads off a `parseChatMetadata(…)` result, the idiom the Engine actually
 *       uses most and the only one that reaches `scenario`; and
 *       `CHAT_PRESET_EXCLUDED_METADATA_KEYS` (`packages/shared/src/types/chat-preset.ts`), which is
 *       not a sweep at all but the list the Engine already hand-maintains of the keys that belong
 *       to a chat rather than to a reusable settings profile. That list is the only source that
 *       reaches `spatialContext`, and it reaches it precisely because the six sweeps cannot.
 *  Plus `persona`, an engine namespace no current key happens to start with; it is floored
 *  explicitly rather than left to appear the day something claims it.
 *
 *  What the derivation CANNOT see, stated plainly, in two shapes. A write whose payload is a
 *  variable or a helper's return value (`patchMetadata(id, hydratedMeta)`, or the same shape on the
 *  metadata route) commits keys no static sweep in this repository can read; there are twenty-one
 *  such calls, and the regression pins that count so a new one fails until someone reads it by
 *  hand. The Advanced Memory import remap is the twenty-first, audited under `advancedMemory`, `summary`,
 *  and `last`. And a read that happens INSIDE a helper, off a parameter rather than off a name a sweep
 *  recognizes, is interprocedural and out of reach of every read arm here: `spatialContext` is
 *  written into chat metadata by the hierarchical-maps package's own client — code that ships from
 *  the Agents repository, so no write site here names it — and read back by
 *  `hasUsableHierarchicalWorldMap(current)` off a `patchMetadata` updater's parameter and by a
 *  file-local `parseMetadata()` in the capability migration. Widening a sweep does not close that
 *  shape; source 7 does, which is why a curated Engine list sits beside six derivations here.
 *  Everything else is derived. */
