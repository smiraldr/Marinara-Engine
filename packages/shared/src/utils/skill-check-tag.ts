 * Whether the engine may roll this tag itself.
 *
 * The engine implements exactly one system: one d20 — two under advantage or
 * disadvantage, which it labels itself — plus the sheet's flat modifier against
 * a DC. A tag that declares anything else names rules the engine does not have,
 * so the only honest answer is to leave the GM's tag standing.
 *
 * This must be asked **in addition to** `resolvedResult`, never instead of it.
 * An absent `resolvedResult` says only that the numbers are not vouched for, and
 * a pool tag that omits `modifier=`, or lists five dice where it declared six,
 * comes back looking exactly like a sparse d20 request. Answering that with a
 * d20 does not fix the tag — it deletes a V20 check and writes a D&D one in its
 * place, in the text that is about to be saved and read back as fact.
 *
 * Refusing a `dice=` label this reader cannot restate exactly (`"1d20+3"`, `""`,
 * `"pool"`) is the same judgement. `"1d20+3"` is the sharp one: it *is* a d20,
 * but the engine's modifier comes from the sheet, so rolling it would drop the
 * GM's flat bonus and relabel the tag `dice="1d20"` as if it had never asked.
 *
 * The die *count* is held to the same standard as the notation, so the declared
 * label and the mode have to agree with each other: one die normally, two under
 * advantage or disadvantage. `dice="2d20"` with no mode asks for a system where
 * two dice are thrown for a straight check, which the engine does not have —
 * answering it with one die and relabelling it `dice="1d20"` is the same silent
 * rewrite as answering a pool with a d20.
 *
 * A tag declaring BOTH modes is refused for that same reason, and it is the
 * sharpest case of it. The roller cancels the pair and throws a single normal
 * die, while this function used to read the pair as "two dice wanted" and pass
 * `dice="2d20" mode="advantage" disadvantage` as rollable — so the GM's declared
 * two dice came back as one, relabelled `dice="1d20" mode="normal"`, in the text
 * about to be saved. The guide already promises a check is never rolled with
 * both at once; refusing the tag keeps that promise as a refusal instead of
 * keeping it as a rewrite.
