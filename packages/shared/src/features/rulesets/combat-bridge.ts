// The combat bridge: what a ruleset sheet lends to a battle, and what a battle writes back.
//
// This is NOT a combat adapter. It adds no attack rolls, no saving throws and no concentration, and
// it changes no damage arithmetic: a fight still runs on the Engine's own combat model. All it does
// is move numbers across the seam, both ways, for a ruleset that opted in with a `battle` block.
// Because the damage stays the Engine's, hit points cross as a SHARE of the maximum rather than as
// raw numbers; energy and slots are small counts spent one at a time, so they cross as they are.
//
// Everything here is pure, reads only the definition, the build and the stored live blob, and never
// throws. A ruleset with no `battle` block gets nothing from any of it, so a battle in that game is
// byte for byte the battle it was before.
