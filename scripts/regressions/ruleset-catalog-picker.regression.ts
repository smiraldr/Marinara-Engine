// The ruleset catalog picker's decidable half, driven through the REAL exported helpers and the
// REAL example ruleset, so nothing here can agree with a mistake the picker also makes.
//
// What it pins: the filter options a catalog offers come from the entries and sort the way their
// type reads; a filter with `startFrom` opens on the sheet's own value, case and label included;
// an entry the sheet already holds is marked from ANY list the catalog feeds; a selection reports
// what each list gains against the room it has, drops a row the ruleset would refuse, and names a
// list it would overflow; and the mechanics line is built entirely from localization keys and the
// ruleset's own labels, so nothing in it is shaped to one system.
