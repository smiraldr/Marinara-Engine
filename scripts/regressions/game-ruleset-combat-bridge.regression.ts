/**
 * The ruleset combat bridge: the optional `battle` block, and the three pure helpers that lend a
 * battle the sheet's numbers and write the fight's outcome back.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - Nothing is 5e-shaped. Every pool, list, column and word comes from the ruleset that declares
 *     it, and the ruleset used for the skills half rolls 2d6 and has no slots at all.
 *   - A ruleset with no `battle` block gets nothing: no seed, no skills, no operations.
 *   - Health crosses as a SHARE of the maximum, both ways, on the Engine's own scale: a fight that
 *     did not move the combatant writes nothing, nobody above zero is rounded out of a fight or off
 *     a sheet, and zero stays zero. Energy and slots stay absolute counts.
 *   - Every name inside `battle` points at something that exists, and a pool cannot be two things.
 *   - Only a row a catalog wrote, whose entry carries `mechanics`, becomes a combat skill, and a
 *     cost the Engine cannot spend takes the skill away rather than making it free.
 *   - `power` never falls as the dice grow, and never leaves the range a generated skill lives in.
 *   - The operations are the deltas, they go through the same `applyRulesetSheetOp` a player's own
 *     buttons go through, and a refused one changes nothing and is reported.
